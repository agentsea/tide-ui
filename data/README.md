# Data

There are two processes that are involved in the generation of the data:

1. Collect screenshots from a specific UI
2. Annotate the elements in the screenshots

The first one can be done by running a process that gets screenshots while a user interacts with the UI. A simple PoC of how this can be done can be found in `screenshots.ipynb`
